# Overview

The Monday Morning Readout is a modern dashboard application built to visualize and interact with data stored in a Supabase database. It provides an insight into team activity on a week-to-week basis

# Core Features

1. Data Visualization
   - Visually pleasing, easy to understand graphs
   - Minimal text on screen unless in expanded mode
   - Strong colors, large images/icons. Used in presentation

# User Experience

Primary User: Software Development Company team
Key Flows:

- Dashboard visualization
- At-a-glance team-wide view or
- Expanded, single user view

# Technical Architecture

Stack:

- Frontend: NextJS 14+ with App Router
- Database: Existing Supabase instance
- State Management: React Query for server state
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components

Components:

- Layout system with responsive grid
- Reusable chart components

Data Flow:

- Server-side data fetching with NextJS
- Type-safe database queries

# Development Roadmap

Phase 1 - Foundation & Auth:

- Project setup with NextJS
- Supabase client configuration
- Basic layout and navigation
- TypeScript types for database schema

Phase 2 - Core Dashboard:

- Main dashboard layout
- Initial data fetching logic
- Basic chart implementations
- Loading and error states
- Responsive design implementation

# Logical Dependency Chain

1. Project Foundation

   - NextJS setup with TypeScript
   - Supabase client integration
   - Basic routing structure

2. Data Layer

   - Loading states

# Risks and Mitigations

Technical Challenges:

- Risk: Performance with large datasets
  Mitigation: Implement pagination and virtual scrolling

- Risk: Type safety with Supabase
  Mitigation: Generate types from database schema

Resource Constraints:

- Risk: Complex chart requirements
  Mitigation: Use established charting libraries
