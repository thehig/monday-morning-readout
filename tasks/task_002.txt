# Task ID: 2
# Title: Configure Supabase Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Supabase connection and implement secure credential management for the existing database.
# Details:
Configure the connection to the existing Supabase project and po_feedback table. Implement a secure credential management system where:
1. Environment variables for Supabase credentials and API endpoints will be stored locally
2. During the build process, these credentials will be encrypted using CryptoJS PBKDF2 with a password stored as a separate environment variable
3. The encrypted credentials will be included in the final build, allowing secure deployment without exposing raw secrets

The po_feedback table schema includes: id (primary key), submitted_by (email), created_at (timestamp), week_number (integer), progress_percent (integer 0-100), team_happiness (integer 1-5), customer_happiness (integer 1-5), velocity_next_week (enum: 'Rot', 'Gelb', 'Gr√ºn'), milestones_done (text, nullable), and risks (text, nullable).

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify connection to Supabase using the existing credentials
2. Test the encryption/decryption process:
   - Ensure environment variables are correctly encrypted during build
   - Verify the application can decrypt and use the credentials at runtime
3. Perform basic CRUD operations on the po_feedback table to validate the connection works end-to-end
