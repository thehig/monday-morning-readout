# Task ID: 2
# Title: Configure Supabase Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Supabase connection and create the required database schema for storing PO feedback.
# Details:
Create a Supabase project and configure the po_feedback table with all required fields: id (primary key), submitted_by (email), created_at (timestamp), week_number (integer), progress_percent (integer 0-100), team_happiness (integer 1-5), customer_happiness (integer 1-5), velocity_next_week (enum: 'Rot', 'Gelb', 'Gr√ºn'), milestones_done (text, nullable), and risks (text, nullable). Set up environment variables for Supabase credentials and API endpoints.

# Test Strategy:
Test the connection to Supabase by performing basic CRUD operations on the po_feedback table. Verify that all fields are correctly defined and constraints are working as expected.
