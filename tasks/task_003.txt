# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Authentication System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up authentication using Supabase Auth to protect routes and secure API endpoints.
# Details:
Implement authentication using Supabase Auth. Create protected routes that require authentication. Set up a login page and authentication context to manage user state throughout the application. Implement secure API endpoints that verify authentication tokens before allowing access to data.

# Test Strategy:
Test login functionality, verify that protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to the login page, and confirm that API endpoints reject requests without valid authentication tokens.
