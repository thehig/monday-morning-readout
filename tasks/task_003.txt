# Task ID: 3
# Title: Generate TypeScript Types from Database Schema
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create type definitions for the database schema to ensure type safety
# Details:
Use Supabase's type generation tools to create TypeScript types from the existing database schema. Organize types in a dedicated 'types' directory. Create interfaces for all database tables and relationships. Implement utility types for common query patterns. Ensure types are properly exported and available throughout the application.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that generated types match the actual database schema. Test type compatibility with sample queries. Ensure IntelliSense provides proper type hints when using the database client.
