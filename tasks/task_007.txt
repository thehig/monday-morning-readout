# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Chart Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop reusable chart components using Recharts or Chart.js
# Details:
Select and install either Recharts or Chart.js. Create wrapper components for common chart types (bar, line, pie). Implement theming that aligns with the requirement for strong colors. Create higher-order components for data transformation. Ensure charts are responsive and visually appealing. Focus on minimal text display as per requirements.

# Test Strategy:
Test charts with various data sets. Verify responsiveness of charts at different screen sizes. Ensure accessibility features are working. Test performance with larger data sets.
