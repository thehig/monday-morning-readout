# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the main dashboard grid to display feedback cards with proper loading states and empty state handling.
# Details:
Implement the dashboard grid to display feedback cards sorted by submission date (most recent first). Create skeleton placeholders for loading states. Implement empty state handling for weeks with no feedback. Ensure proper spacing and visual hierarchy. Connect the grid to the week navigation system to display data for the selected week.

# Test Strategy:
Test the grid with various data scenarios including: multiple cards, single card, no cards, and loading state. Verify sorting works correctly and that the empty state is displayed appropriately.
