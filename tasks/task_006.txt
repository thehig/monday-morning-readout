# Task ID: 6
# Title: Create Feedback Card Component
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the feedback card component with all required visual elements and interactive states.
# Details:
Create a reusable feedback card component that displays: PO name (derived from email), submission date with relative time, progress indicator (animated thermometer), team and customer happiness scores with emoji visualization, and next week's velocity indicator using the traffic light system. Implement hover scaling effect, active state feedback, and cursor pointer indication. Use white background with subtle shadow and border.

# Test Strategy:
Test the component with various input data combinations. Verify all visual elements render correctly and that interactive states work as expected. Check accessibility of interactive elements.
