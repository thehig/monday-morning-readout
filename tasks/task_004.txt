# Priority: high
# Description: Develop utility functions for week number calculation, date formatting, and week boundary determination.
# Details:
Create utility functions to: 1) Calculate the current week number based on the calendar year, 2) Determine week start (Monday) and end (Friday) dates, 3) Handle year transitions properly, 4) Format dates in short, long, and ISO formats, and 5) Generate relative time strings (e.g., '2 days ago'). Ensure proper handling of week boundaries across year transitions.
