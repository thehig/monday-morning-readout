# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Dashboard Layout and Navigation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the main dashboard layout with responsive grid system and week navigation controls.
# Details:
Develop the main dashboard layout with a fixed header containing navigation controls and week selection. Implement URL-based week navigation with query parameters. Create a responsive grid system that adjusts columns based on screen size (1 column for mobile, 2 for tablet, 3 for desktop, 4 for large screens). Ensure the layout preserves week context across navigation.

# Test Strategy:
Test the responsive behavior across different screen sizes. Verify that week navigation works correctly and that the URL updates appropriately. Check that the week context is preserved when navigating between pages.
