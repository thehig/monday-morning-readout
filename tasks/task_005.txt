# Title: Create Data Fetching Hooks with React Query
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop reusable data fetching hooks using React Query for server state management
# Details:
Install React Query v5. Create custom hooks for fetching data from Supabase. Implement proper caching strategies. Set up error handling and loading states. Create hooks for different data entities needed in the dashboard. Implement pagination for large datasets to address performance concerns.

# Test Strategy:
Test hooks with mock data. Verify that caching works as expected. Test error handling by simulating network failures. Ensure loading states are properly triggered and resolved.
