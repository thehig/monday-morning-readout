# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the two-column layout for the detailed feedback view page.
# Details:
Create the detailed feedback view with a two-column layout. Left column should contain status and progress information (submitter details, submission timestamp, sprint progress, completed milestones, risks). Right column should display metrics and planning information (team and customer satisfaction scores, average satisfaction, happiness indicators, velocity indicator). Include back navigation with state preservation.

# Test Strategy:
Test the layout on different screen sizes to ensure responsive behavior. Verify that all sections are displayed correctly and that back navigation preserves the state.
