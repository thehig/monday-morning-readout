# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Performance Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Add performance enhancements for handling large datasets
# Details:
Implement virtual scrolling for large data lists. Add pagination for data fetching to reduce initial load time. Optimize React rendering with memoization where appropriate. Implement data prefetching for common navigation patterns. Add Suspense boundaries for improved loading states. Configure proper caching strategies for React Query.

# Test Strategy:
Perform performance testing with large datasets. Measure and compare load times before and after optimizations. Test memory usage. Verify that UI remains responsive with large data volumes. Test on lower-end devices to ensure broad compatibility.
